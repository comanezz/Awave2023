# Awave 2023

It is a website to show off my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills. 

This is a one page site, the anchor links do not redirect to another page. 

# **Demo**
A live demo can be found [here](https://comanezz.github.io/Awave2023/).

## Features
The page has a responsive Navbar. On small screen, there is a menu button toggle. The menu slides to the right for the menu and to the left when clicking on the shopping button. 
There is also slide effect when navigating in the menu toggled. 

I implemented a carousel. 

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Javascript**

## Problems
- I was not able to implement the looping in the carousel.
